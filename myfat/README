-- How to create a file for loopback.
  >> dd if=/dev/zero of=/virtualfs bs=1024 count=307200


-- use loopon.sh / loopdown.sh to connect the loop device with the file


-- format the block device
  >> mkfs.msdos -F 32 /dev/loop0


-- use starttest.sh / stoptest.sh to do the test


-- Where to find original Linux modules
  /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs/fat

-- routine way to do the test
   1. We use two machines, one for development (dev) and one for test (test).
      Create a file for loopback on the test machine and then create the virtual hard disk.

   2. shell_script/loaddev.sh

   3. shell_script/starttest.sh

   4. less /var/log/messages (shift + f)

   * hint *
   On test machine, we'd better "su" first before doing the test. This can save us from
   lots of trouble concerning permission. If we cannot "su" (e.g. on Ubuntu system), we
   can also use "sudo". We can also use "sudo" to execute shell by the following
   ======================
   sudo sh -c xxx.sh
   sudo sh -c "cat > aaa.txt"
   ======================
